        Moderator: Alright, let's move on to the exciting world of domestic policy. Polls show that domestic
        policy is one of the most important issues for Americans, so let's be thorough. Ms. Blue, please, go ahead.

        Betty: This last year has been a tough one for many Americans, but frankly protesters are acting out and it just isn't acceptable.
        In order to improve domestic policy, Americans must be forced to comply! Also, our immigration policy is simply outrageous!

        Betty: The NFL should punish any football player from kneeling while the national anthem is being performed. It is unpatriotic and extremely rude to all our 
        veterans and people who have fought for our country. The NFL should take swift action against these acts!
        <animation id="Betty" animation="Betty_betty_serious"/>
        Betty: Speaking of unpatriotic actions, burning the American flag should be illegal. It is shameful to see our country's pride and
        symbol go up in flames. Once again, it is disrespectful to our veterans and to the people of the United States!
        <animation id="Betty" animation="Betty_betty_talk"/>
        Betty: As more and more immigrants flood to the United States, we should open our borders  even more to all refugees and any citizens of the
        world seeking shelter to the United States! The United States welcomes immigrants and should continue to do so by
        making our borders completely open.
        Alice: (Is she being serious...)
        : (Alright, just like before! Time to show her why her plans won't work!)

        Alice: Ms. Blue, earlier you were saying terrorists should be tortured and their families killed. Now you're supporting policies that would help them get into America. Isn't there a bit of a discrepancy there?
        Betty: Stop thinking so small, Ms. Wonder. A few terrorists is a small price to pay for all the good it would do. What about all of the refugees across the world that could benefit from my policy?

        Betty: Oh really now? Please, go on.
        Alice: Kneeling during the national anthem is free speech! You can't punish players for exercising their rights!
        <animation id="Betty" animation="Betty_betty_smug"/>
        Betty: You're right, of course, but what you fail to grasp is that I won't be the one punishing them. I'm simply calling on NFL owners to do so.
        Your precious little First Amendment may stop the Federal Government and states from preventing free speech, but the NFL isn't the government!

        Betty: What am I looking at, besides your pathetic excuse for clothing?
        Alice: What you should really be looking at is this landmark court case, Texas v. Johnson!
        Betty: Landmark? I've never heard of it.
        Alice: That doesn't surprise me. If you had known it, you would also know the critical mistake you made.
        Betty: Why you...!
        <animation id="Alice" animation="Alice_mc_talk_normal"/>
        Alice: In 1988, the Supreme Court handed down a ruling on an incident where Gregory Lee Johnson was convicted after burning a flag in protest. The Supreme Court decided that the flag burning was a form of protest and free speech.
        Betty: You don't mean...!
        <animation id="Alice" animation="Alice_mc_smug"/>
        Alice: That's right, Ms. Blue! Your plan to make flag burning illegal is a violation of free speech! Your unconstitutional policy will never happen, not with Texas v. Johnson standing!
        Betty: Nooooooooooooooooo!
        Alice: (Yes! I damaged her credibility again! Just a little more now...! Wait, why does she have more papers on her desk?)
        Moderator: Well, that was certainly a stunning turn of events. I think we better move on now...
