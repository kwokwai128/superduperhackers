        Betty: Thank you once again Wolf.
        <animation id="Betty" animation="Betty_betty_serious"/>
        Betty: The US does not have to police the world. It is shameful that other governments in NATO refuse to
        pay their fair share while America is forced to spend unthinkable amounts of money to make up for everyone
        else. It's ab-so-lute-ly unlawful.
        <animation id="Betty" animation="Betty_betty_angry" />
        Betty: Terrorists are killing our citizens left and right, so we should continue to waterboard against the
        terrorists if we want to find out where their colleagues are hiding. When they harm our families and friends,
        it only makes sense to return the favor.
        <animation id="Betty" animation="Betty_betty_talk" />
        Betty: China has continued to make these fake bogus islands in the South China Sea. It is unlawful and should be
        condemned by everyone. The US should take action on behalf of the UN!

        Betty: Russia has nukes. The US has nukes. We need to build even more nukes.

        <animation id="Alice" animation="Alice_mc_sweat" />
        Alice: (Something doesn't seem right again! It was pretty cool when I pointed out she was wrong. Maybe
        she slipped up again? I should press for more information or present evidence that
        one of her plans would be unconstitutional.)

        Alice: America is the richest country in the entire world. Don't you think we could spare a little for poorer
        nations?
        <animation id="Betty" animation="Betty_betty_talk" />
        Betty: The American soldiers' sole duty is to defend the citizens of the United States who pay their salaries
        and owe allegiance to the United States.

        Betty: Poorer nations should be thankful that we've stayed in NATO this long. Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians,
        Croatians, and Albanians should learn to defend themselves,
        and when I'm president, they'll have to!

        Moderator: Why's that?

        Alice: That area is riddled with conflict, Mr. Blitzer. It's incredibly unstable.

        Betty: Don't worry Wolf, after this debate we can take a my private jet to my beautiful private island on the
        coast of Africa.
        Alice: (Private jet? Private island? I want those.)
        Alice: (Also when did Betty get so close to Mr. Blitzer?)

        Betty: Is it now? France, India and the UK have nukes and anything can happen.  I've met with the President
        about our nuclear arsenal.

        Alice: (Though a bit crazy, it doesn't sound illegal if the President was involved.)

        Alice: Ms. Blue, someone on your debate team is getting fired because your deadly proposal is @c{intense} unconstitutional!
        Moderator: What!? You mean we can't kill terrorists families?
        Alice: May I point your attention to the Eighth Amendment! No cruel and unusual punishments can be inflicted by the government!
        <animation id="Betty" animation="Betty_betty_sweat" />
        Betty: What?! It doesn't sound unusual to me!
        Alice: It's pretty basic knowledge, Ms. Blue, I thought you would have known that. Especially with your years of experience.
        Alice: (Ms. Blue looks distracted... is she flipping through papers again? Something doesn't seem right...)
        Betty: Ah ha!
        Moderator: Is something wrong Ms. Blue?
        Betty: Though it may violate the 8th Amendment, it isn't exactly @c{intense} unconstitutional!

        Betty: Technically it may be cruel and unusual, the CIA has continued to exercise these practices! There aren't any court cases or laws stating
        these actions are illegal!
        Alice: (You can't be serious...)
        Moderator: Ms. Blue has a point but Ms. Alice you have made a serious note about Ms. Blue's plan. We will let the American people decide.
