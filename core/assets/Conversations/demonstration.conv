        Librarian: It was. We aren't sure how he got in here in the first place.

        Detective: Chefs? I don't recall mentioning that the victim was a chef.
        @c{confront} Just how did you know that?

        Librarian: I... uh... @c{delay} saw his chef's hat.

        Detective: (His story's getting phonier by the minute. Now I've just got to break through
        his lies once and for all!)
