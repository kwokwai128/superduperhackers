        Alice: There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Ms. Blue.
        <animation id="Betty" animation="Betty_betty_smug"/>
        Betty: Well I normally don't answer personal questions, but I suppose just this once.
        Alice: It's not really a personal question. Rather... those papers you have.
        <animation id="Betty" animation="Betty_betty_sweat"/>
        Betty: Papers? What papers?
        Alice: The ones on your podium. Every time I point out flaws in your plans you start looking through papers. Just where are they coming from?
        Betty: I hardly think this is relevant, my dear.
        <animation id="Alice" animation="Alice_mc_normal"/>
        Alice: Wolf, please. Don't you think it's odd too?

        Betty: Wolf, I'm warning you. Don't do this.
        Moderator: I...
        Betty: Do you really want to be an enemy of the future president?
        Moderator: No, I suppose not, but...
        Betty: The debate is over. End it now.
        <animation id="Moderator" animation="Wolf_Wolf_looking"/>
        Moderator: Very well, this debate is now...
        <animation id="Alice" animation="Alice_mc_angry"/>
        Alice: Just one moment!
        Betty: What do you want now?
        Alice: I say we search Ms. Blue's podium! Something suspicious is going on here!
        <animation id="Betty" animation="Betty_betty_smug"/>
        Betty: This is a presidential debate. It only makes sense that we would follow the Constitution even in our proceedings. Do you remember what the Constitution says about this?
        : No unreasonable search and seizures!
        Moderator: I guess that... kind of makes sense... I mean this is just a debate but still...
        <animation id="Alice" animation="Alice_mc_smug"/>
        Alice: Ms. Blue, do you know what your weakness is?
        <animation id="Betty" animation="Betty_betty_angry"/>
        Betty: Weakness...!
        Alice: You don't really understand the Constitution. How can you possibly lead a country without understanding its government?
        Betty: Why you...!

        Alice: When you said no unreasonable search and seizures, you were of course referring to this amendment...

        Alice: You were referring to the Fourth Amendment! It states that there are to be no unreasonable search and seizures. But it isn't ironclad.
        Moderator: Well, that's true in some cases. What do you mean though?
        Alice: I mean that there's a crucial exception. If Ms. Blue intends to argue that we should honor the Constitution now, she must honor everything.
        Betty: You...

        Alice: The Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Santana that if there is probable cause, then a search may be valid.
        Specifically, they said that since Santana was standing on a porch he had no reasonable expectation of privacy.
        Alice: I'd say those same conditions are met now. We've seen you holding suspicious papers with no clear origin. Seems like
        probable cause to me. And expectation of privacy? You're on national TV in front of millions of viewers! How can you expect to
        have privacy!
        Moderator: That's true!
        Alice: Wolf, search her podium, immediately!
        Moderator: What... what is this! The podium is hollow! There's an elevator in here!
        Alice: What!? An elevator?
        Moderator: She's been getting papers sent up from under the stage by her debate preparation team!
        <animation id="Betty" animation="Betty_betty_angry"/>
        Betty: You're wrong... you're... no! This can't be happening! I was supposed to be president! ME! MEEEEEEE!
        Alice: I'm sorry, Ms. Blue, but without an understanding of the Constitution, you don't deserve to be president.
        Betty: Alice... Wonder. Alice Wonder. Aliiiiiiiice Wooooooooooooonder! This isn't the end! You haven't seen the last of me!

        Moderator: Well, I've never seen anything like this before in my career... I suppose, by default, the winner of this debate...
        : ...is Alice Wonder! Congratulations!
