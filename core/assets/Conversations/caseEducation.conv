        : We continue to see African Americans, Hispanics, Asians and other minorities underrepresented in many
        universities. Universities should take drastic action to increase the enrollment numbers of minorities!
        : Districts should not be required to spend equal amounts of money between poor neighborhoods and
        less-poor neighborhoods. We need less government regulation and should allow the states to decide.
        : We should have a report card for every teacher and school to determine funding, based on their performance.
        Good schools get more money while poor schools get less money.
        : Standardized testing is turning students into passive test-taking machines. It fails to incorporate multilevel
        thinking and disregards students’ full potential.

        Alice: Something seems wrong here... I should press for more information or present evidence that
        one of her plans would be unconstitutional.

        Alice: What are the standards for dividing the funding?
        <animation id="Betty" animation="Betty_betty_smug"/>
        Betty: Ah, yes. I was anticipating your question.
        <animation id="Betty" animation="Betty_betty_talk"/>
        Betty: Instead of equal distribution, state governments should base its funding on
        other factors such as condition of the school, need for supplies and resources,
        etc.
        Alice: How are you going to inspect those factors?
        <animation id="Betty" animation="Betty_betty_smug"/>
        Betty: Easy. Each district will send an inspector to its schools and provide a
        report of schools’ conditions for the state to evaluate.
        And a new job is created! Look at that.

        Alice: Isn’t that a little unfair? Aren’t you discriminating kids over their grades? alice_sweat
        Betty: Hardly. I see no problem in giving more resources to kids with more
        potential. I believe in psychology, this is called positive reinforcement.
        Alice: But…
        <animation id="Betty" animation="Betty_betty_talk"/>
        Betty: (Cuts Alice off) I know all about what you are thinking, Ms.Wonder. betty_talk
        Betty: I also want states to give schools with big enrollment of students larger
        amounts of funding. There should be a student population ratio to money to also
        determine how much funding each school receives.
        Betty: This balances the funding by performance.
        <animation id="Moderator" animation="Wolf_Wolf_looking"/>
        Moderator: Ms. Blue, you have really thought about this.

        Betty: Undoubtedly, some kind of standardized testing is needed for national consistency,
        but we should radically reform the current system.
        <animation id="Alice" animation="Alice_mc_smug"/>
        Alice: I agree! A system which repeatedly tries to measure students by a limited number of skill sets--

        Alice: But I must inform you that your idea violates @c{intense} a supreme court case!
        Moderator: It… it does?!
        Alice: Take a look at this, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke. upheld affirmation action,
        allowing race to be one of the factors determining college admission.
        Alice: It ruled, however, a specific racial quotas are illegal!
        <animation id="Betty" animation="Betty_betty_sweat"/>
        Betty: What?! My debate preparation team never mentioned that!
        Alice: This is a pretty well known court ruling. With years in the political scene, shouldn't you be familiar
        with these kind of knowledge?

        Alice: (Ms. Blue looks distracted… is she flipping through papers again? This is getting more and more suspicious)
