        Alice: My name is Alice.

        Distant: (Hello. Welcome to the first 2016 U.S. Presidential Debate! ...)

        Alice: I am exactly 35 years old. I am one of the youngest presidential candidates to make it this far.

        Moderator: (... We're happy to be here today with the two leading voices of our nation and hear their views on
        various controversial topics...
        :...Please welcome presidential candidates Betty Blue and Alice Wonder!) *cheering*


        Alice: I've spent my entire life preparing for this moment. I'm a little nervous.
        : I have a soft heart, but a loud voice, and that's why I'm here today.

        Betty: Thank you Moderator Wolf.
        : Good evening everyone. I am Betty Blue, your next US President!
        : Americans are tired of having their voices ignored by the federal government.
        : It is ab-so-lu-te-ly horrible and terrifying to see so many Americans being ignored and their voices
        drowned in a sea of bureaucratic red tape.
        : With me as your president, I will assure that every gun in America is confiscated
        so that no more children will die from treacherous gun violence.
        : Furthermore, oil companies should continue to drill away as it provides jobs, money and fuel to the
        US economy.
        : Let us take back the federal government from the corrupt politicians of Washington and
        restore the power of the common people!
        Alice: Something seems wrong here... I should press for more information or present evidence that
        one of her plans would be unconstitutional.

        Betty: Yes! It takes years for anything to get done. We need to cut more and more red tape!

        Betty: You know what, Ms. Wonder, I'm taking that as a compliment.
        Alice: ...How exactly...
        Betty: I DO have years of federal government experience. Just the other day I was playing a spectacular round of golf with Senator Blake. Have you played golf with Senator Blake? Or any Senator for that matter?
        Moderator: Great point, Ms. Blue! Your golf game is on point!

        Moderator: I don't see how that evidence proves anything.
        Alice: (And now the only one weeping is me. But there's definitely something wrong...
        I just have to find the illegal or unconstitutional statement and present evidence that proves it!)

        Alice: Ms. Blue, I appreciate your sentiment. No Americans should fall victim to gun violence. But in addition to being outrageous, your plan would be @c{intense} unconstitutional!
        Moderator: It… it is?!
        Alice: Just take a look at this, the Second Amendment! People have the right to bear arms,and that means keeping guns!
        Betty: What?! My debate preparation team never mentioned that!
        Alice: It's pretty basic knowledge, Ms. Blue, I thought you would have known that. Especially with your years of experience.
        Alice: (Ms. Blue looks distracted… is she flipping through papers? But we weren't supposed to have any prewritten notes on the stage. Just when did she get those?)
        Moderator: Ahem, alright. Thank you ladies for your introduction.
        <pausemusic/>
        Alice: (Wait, I didn't give an introduction yet...)
        Moderator: We may now begin the debate. First on the chopping block is foreign policy. Betty, you may begin.
        Alice: (What about me???)
        Alice: (It looks like the only way to get my foot in the door is to find the flaws in Betty's stances.)
