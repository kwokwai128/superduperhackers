        Alice: My name is Alice.

        Distant: (Hello. Welcome to the first 2017 U.S. Presidential Debate! . . .)

        Alice: I am exactly 35 years old. I am one of the youngest presidential candidates to make it this far.

        Moderator: (. . . We’re happy to be here today with the two leading voices of our nation and hear their views on
        various controversial topics. . .
        : . . .Please welcome presidential candidates Betty ____ and Alice _____!) *cheering*


        Alice: I’ve spent my entire life preparing for this moment. I’m a little nervous. @c{delay} I have a soft heart
        but a loud voice, and that’s why I’m here today.

        Betty: Thank you Moderator Wolf.
        : Good evening everyone. I am Betty (last name), your next US President!
        : Americans are tired of having their voices ignored by the federal government.
        : It is ab-so-lu-te-ly horrible and terrifying to see so many Americans being ignored and their voices
        drowned in a sea of bureaucratic red tape.
        : Americans should not own any guns as they are dangerous for children. So many kids are dying each day
        from gun violence.
        : Furthermore, oil companies should continue to drill away as it provides jobs, money and fuel to the
        US economy.
        : Let us make America again. Let us take back the federal government from the corrupt politicians of
        Washington so we can make American beautiful again.
